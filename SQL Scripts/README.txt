These scripts are intended to be used for 'priming' a database with system fields. When the system fields are added before syncing a tenant, less work needs to be done, so there is less chance of a timeout.

The scripts can be used to add system fields to all tables at once, or for a single company in case adding them to all companies takes too long.
